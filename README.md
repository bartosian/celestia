Welcome to the Celestia Tools repository! This repository houses a collection of services and tools meticulously crafted for monitoring the Celestia network and its constituent entities.

### About **Celestia**

* Celestia is a modular consensus and data network, built to enable anyone to easily deploy their own blockchain with minimal overhead.

* Celestia provides consensus and security on-demand, enabling anyone to deploy a blockchain without the overhead of bootstrapping a new consensus network.

* Blockchains built on top of Celestia do not rely on honest majority assumptions for state validity, meaning that they can interoperate with the highest security standards.

* Because Celestia does not validate transactions, its throughput is not bottlenecked by state execution like traditional blockchains. Thanks to a property of data availability sampling, Celestia‚Äôs throughput scales with the number of users.
